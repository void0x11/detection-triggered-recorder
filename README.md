# Detection-Triggered Recorder

**Intelligent event-driven surveillance system with real-time human detection, automatic recording, and persistent snapshot evidence.**

An AI-powered security monitoring application that automatically captures video and timestamped snapshots when humans are detected, providing comprehensive evidence even if the camera connection is interrupted.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Smart Detection & Recording
- **Real-Time Detection**: YOLOv8 neural network processes 30 FPS video stream for instant human detection
- **Automatic Recording**: Records only when humans detected (no wasted storage on empty scenes)
- **Intelligent Cooldown**: 6-second recording buffer after person leaves frame prevents fragmented clips
- **Continuous Monitoring**: System stays alert 24/7 in standby mode with minimal CPU usage

### Persistent Evidence Collection
- **Automatic Snapshots**: Captures timestamped image every 15 seconds during detection
- **Timestamp Overlay**: Detection time written directly on each snapshot (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Backup Protection**: If camera disconnects mid-recording, you still have photo evidence every 15 seconds
- **Organized Storage**: Separate folders for videos (`recordings/`) and images (`snapshots/`)

### User Interface
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes, perfect for 24/7 monitoring setups
- **Live Status Display**:
  - 🟢 **Person Detection** - Shows when humans are detected (🔴 when active)
  - 🟢 **Recording Status** - Standby / Recording / Cooldown states
  - 🟢 **System Status** - Real-time system health monitoring
- **Live Video Feed**: Real-time camera stream with detection bounding boxes
- **Maximizable Window**: Resize to any screen size
- **USB Camera Support**: Works with OBSBOT Tiny 2, standard webcams, and V4L2 devices

## 🎬 How It Works

### Detection & Recording Flow

```
Person Enters Frame
        ↓
[Detection: 🔴 DETECTED]
        ↓
Recording Starts (Video begins)
[Recording: 🔴 RECORDING]
        ↓
Person Still In Frame
        ↓
Video Continues + Snapshot Every 15 Sec
        ↓
Person Leaves Frame
        ↓
[Recording: 🟡 COOLDOWN] (6 seconds)
        ↓
If Person Returns → Resume Recording
If No Person After 6 Sec → Stop Recording
[Recording: 🟢 Standby]
```

### Why Snapshots Every 15 Seconds?

**Scenario: Camera Tampering or Disconnection**

| Time | Event | Video | Snapshot |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| 14:30:00 | Person detected | ▶️ Recording starts | 📸 Image 1 |
| 14:30:15 | Person in frame | ▶️ Recording continues | 📸 Image 2 |
| 14:30:30 | Person in frame | ▶️ Recording continues | 📸 Image 3 |
| 14:30:45 | **Camera disconnected** | ❌ Recording stops | 📸 Image 4 |
| 14:31:00 | Camera offline | ❌ No video | 📸 Image 5 (last capture) |

**Result**: Even if camera goes offline, you have photographic evidence every 15 seconds starting from detection.

## 📥 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- USB camera or webcam
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 20GB free disk space (for recordings)

### Quick Start

**Option A: Standalone Executable** (Recommended)
```bash
# Just download and run:
Detection-Triggered Recorder.exe
```
No Python or additional setup needed!

**Option B: From Source**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python detection_triggered_recorder_dark.py
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Launch Application**: Run the executable or Python script
2. **Connect USB Camera**: Application automatically detects and selects USB camera
3. **Start Monitoring**: System enters continuous monitoring mode immediately
4. **Monitor Indicators**:
   - Green = Safe/Normal
   - Red = Active/Alert
   - Orange = Transitional (Cooldown)
5. **Exit**: Click "Exit" button to cleanly stop all recording and close application

### Output Files

After monitoring, check:
- **`recordings/`** - Video files: `security_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`
- **`snapshots/`** - Images: `snapshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_mmm.jpg` (with timestamp overlay)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings editable in `detection_triggered_recorder_dark.py`:

| Setting | Location | Value | Purpose |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| Detection Confidence | Line ~73 | 0.0-1.0 | Higher = stricter detection |
| Recording Cooldown | Line ~145 | Seconds | How long after person leaves |
| Snapshot Frequency | Line ~171 | Seconds | Interval between snapshots (15 recommended) |

### Recommended Configuration

```python
# Detection sensitivity - balanced for office environments
confidence_threshold = 0.5  # Good balance between sensitivity and accuracy

# Recording cooldown - 6 seconds
cooldown_seconds = 6  # Enough to capture context, minimal fragmentation

# Snapshot frequency - every 15 seconds
screenshot_cooldown = 15  # Provides clear timeline of detection event
```

## 💾 Storage & Performance

### Expected Storage Usage (24 hours)

| Scenario | Video Size | Snapshots | Total |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Continuous (24/7 recording) | 150-200 GB | 5-10 GB | 160-210 GB |
| Event-Driven (typical office) | 10-20 GB | 2-5 GB | 12-25 GB |
| Sparse events (1-2 per hour) | 1-3 GB | 500MB-1GB | 1.5-4 GB |

### System Requirements

- **CPU**: 15-25% during monitoring, 30-40% during detection/recording
- **RAM**: ~300MB base, ~500MB with models loaded
- **Disk I/O**: Only during recording events (minimal impact)
- **Network**: Not required (works offline)
