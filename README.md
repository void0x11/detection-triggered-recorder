# OBSBOT Tiny2 Intelligent Security Monitor

**Professional event-driven surveillance system with real-time human detection, automatic recording, and persistent snapshot evidence.**

An AI-powered security monitoring application purpose-built for OBSBOT Tiny2 USB cameras. Automatically captures timestamped video and snapshots when humans are detected, providing comprehensive evidence even if the camera connection is interrupted.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Smart Detection & Recording
- **Real-Time Detection**: YOLOv8 neural network processes 30 FPS video stream for instant human detection
- **Automatic Recording**: Records only when humans detected (no wasted storage on empty scenes)
- **Intelligent Cooldown**: 6-second recording buffer after person leaves frame prevents fragmented clips
- **Continuous Monitoring**: System stays alert 24/7 in standby mode with minimal CPU usage

### Persistent Evidence Collection
- **Automatic Snapshots**: Captures timestamped image every 15 seconds during detection
- **Timestamp Overlay**: Detection time written directly on each snapshot (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Backup Protection**: If camera disconnects mid-recording, you still have photo evidence every 15 seconds
- **Organized Storage**: Separate folders for videos (`recordings/`) and images (`snapshots/`)

### User Interface
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes, perfect for 24/7 monitoring setups
- **Live Status Display**:
  - 🟢 **Person Detection** - Shows when humans are detected (🔴 when active)
  - 🟢 **Recording Status** - Standby / Recording / Cooldown states
  - 🟢 **System Status** - Real-time system health monitoring
- **Live Video Feed**: Real-time camera stream with detection bounding boxes
- **Maximizable Window**: Resize to any screen size
- **OBSBOT Tiny2 Optimized**: Perfectly calibrated for OBSBOT Tiny2 USB camera

## 📸 Screenshots & Live Demonstration

### 1️⃣ Main Application GUI (Standby Mode)

![Main GUI](https://github.com/void0x11/Obsbot-Intelligent-Security-Monitor/raw/main/media/GUI.png)

**Application Status**: 
- ✅ System actively monitoring 24/7
- ✅ No person detected → Recording standby
- ✅ Dark theme UI for comfortable viewing
- ✅ Three status indicators clearly visible

**What You See**:
- Camera selector at top (USB Camera 1)
- Large live video feed (empty room)
- Three status boxes: Detection, Recording, System
- All indicators showing 🟢 (Green = Normal/Standby)

### 2️⃣ Person Detected - Recording Started Instantly

![Person Detected](https://github.com/void0x11/Obsbot-Intelligent-Security-Monitor/raw/main/media/snapshot.jpg)

**Instant Actions Triggered**:
- 🔴 **DETECTED** indicator turns red
- 🔴 **RECORDING** starts immediately
- 📸 **First snapshot captured** with timestamp
- 📹 **Video file created** in recordings folder

**What's Happening**:
- Person visible in video feed with green bounding box
- Detection count shows (1) person detected
- Recording status shows active 🔴
- Timestamp overlay on snapshot: `2025-11-04 14:30:15`

**Timeline Start**:
```
T=0s    → Person enters frame
T=0s    → YOLOv8 detection triggers
T=0s    → Recording starts
T=0s    → Snapshot #1 captured & timestamped
```

### 3️⃣ Evidence Backup - Last Snapshot Before Camera Disconnect

![Last Capture](https://github.com/void0x11/Obsbot-Intelligent-Security-Monitor/raw/main/media/still.png)

**Critical Feature Demonstration**:

This screenshot shows why **15-second snapshots are essential for evidence preservation**.

**Scenario: Person detected, then camera loses USB connection**

```
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM (Continuous Recording Only):
═════════════════════════════════════════════════
T=0s  → Recording starts ▶️
T=15s → Recording continues ▶️
T=30s → Recording continues ▶️
T=45s → CAMERA DISCONNECTED ❌
        Video file LOST ❌
RESULT: NO EVIDENCE ❌❌❌

OUR SYSTEM (Recording + 15-Second Snapshots):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
T=0s  → Recording starts + Snapshot #1 📸
T=15s → Recording continues + Snapshot #2 📸
T=30s → Recording continues + Snapshot #3 📸
T=45s → CAMERA DISCONNECTED ❌ + Snapshot #4 📸 CAPTURED!
        Video may be lost, BUT 4 PHOTOS ARE SAFE ✅
RESULT: COMPLETE EVIDENCE ✅✅✅
```

**Each Snapshot Includes**:
- ✅ Exact timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- ✅ High-quality person image
- ✅ Backup proof if video fails
- ✅ Cannot be disputed
